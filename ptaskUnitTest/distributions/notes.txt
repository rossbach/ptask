These distributions were created using the R statistics package (version 2.12.1 - 2010-12-16) 
using the following steps:

> setwd("C:/src/svc/Dandelion")

> c1 = rnorm(n=600,mean = 5,sd =0.5)
> d1 = c(c1)
> hist(d1, 300)
> write.csv(d1, "dist_1.csv")

> c2 = rnorm(n=300, mean = 9, sd = 0.5)
> d2 = c(c1, c2)
> hist(d2, 100)
> write.csv(d2, "dist_2.csv")

> c3 = rnorm(n=100, mean = 15, sd = 1.0)
> d3 = c(c1, c2, c3)
> hist(d3, 100)
> write.csv(d3, "dist_3.csv")
